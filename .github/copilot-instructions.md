Never use the try-catch block, never use classes, always use functions, especially the function keyword, and always use the neverthrow package to handle errors. Always aim for immutability and pure functions, ensuring side effects are managed appropriately.

Prioritize the locality of behavior and data, ensuring that functions are as close to the data they operate on as possible. Always aim for a functional programming style with a Rust flavor using the neverthrow package where appropriate, while possible use the Railway Oriented Programming (ROP) pattern too. Avoid excessive comments and ensure clarity in function definitions.
