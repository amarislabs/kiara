Avoid using TypeScript-specific syntax like enums or namespaces, while the other TypeScript features are allowed.

Always favor fluent and functional programming style with a Rust flavor using the `neverthrow` package where appropriate. Avoid using try-catch blocks and prefer using `neverthrow`'s `Result` or `ResultAsync` types. Avoid using classes and use functions instead. When creating a new function, don't use the arrow function expression but prefer the function keyword.

Use lowercase with dashes for directories and filenames.
